This Rmarkdown file uses the results from OBITools processing as input and further filters the metabarcoding data.
The code provided here is a mash-up from different sources, but primarily the ForBio course: DNA Metabarcoding: Data processing and interpretation.
Special thanks and credit goes to the teachers:
